Service level objectives (SLO):
Targets for service reliability. They define the acceptable levels of performance, availability, and other metrics for a service. SLOs are typically expressed as a percentage or a number of errors per unit of time.

Service level indicators (SLI):
Metrics that measure how close a service is to meeting its SLOs. SLIs are typically quantitative metrics, such as uptime, response time, or error rate.


SLI metrics
Uptime: The percentage of time that a service is available.
Error rate: The percentage of requests that result in an error.
Utilization: The percentage of resources utility.
Latency: The time it takes for a request to travel from the client to the server and back.
Bandwidth: The amount of data that can be transferred between the client and the server per second.
